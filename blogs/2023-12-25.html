            So, I really hate Xfinity's gateway that they provided my family. I
            can't set up VLANs and setting up port forwards requires logging
            into the Xfinity Home app. Why they decided to make it a hassle when
            every other router doesn't need this is beyond me. Worst of all was
            the lack of support for NAT hairpinning and setting a custom DNS
            server. What that means is that I can't access my services using the
            external IP and god forbid I set up PiHole to redirect them to the
            internal IP. Needless to say, I was not a fan of being minorly
            inconvenienced by a decade old modem/router combo that Xfinity
            doesn't even support anymore and costing my family $14/month (Yes, I
            am a very good complainer).

            Say goodbye to ninety dollars and a random night of setting this up,
            but it's time to replace the gateway with a Netgear CM1150V modem
            and pair it a Asus RT-AC68U router.

            I just ended up unplugging cables from the old modem/router gateway
            thingy and plugged them all (Coax, ethernet, and phone) into the
            modem. Then I had to go into the Xfinity app and type in the MAC
            address of the CM1150V and wait like 15 minutes for it work. I had
            to connect my laptop to it by ethernet to make sure it was set up
            but that meant it was time to router setting up.

            I'm not going to get into the setting up of the AC68U router. There
            are plenty of generic guides on YouTube on how to do that and this
            really wasn't anything special. The modem was plug and play besides
            the ISP app demanding the MAC, but the router was pretty standard. I
            kept the SSID and password the same was it was before so that
            devices would reconnect.

            Conclusion: Upgrading your home network by replacing the Xfinity
            gateway with your own used hardware is worth it. Wasn't able to find
            the VLAN settings, but I was able to set up an instance of Adguard
            Home for a DNS-based adblocking. Kinda fun to get working, it should
            pay for itself in about a year.

              >I am going to dump this Xfinity forum link because Asus routers don't like working with Xfinity.
            </a> It probably works, I did a factory reset and update and thats when the router managed to get internet. I'm not entirely sure since
