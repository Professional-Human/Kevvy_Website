          <h1 class="QA_question">Why did you make this site?</h1>
          <p1 class="QA_answer">
            I was bored some HTML5 tutorials popped up on my recommended tab
            and I was in the process of setting up my homelab server. I figured
            if I was going to register a domain, I might as well put a site on
            it. It might be cool to put on something, but mostly as a personal challenge and a bragging right tbh.
            Thank you, Chat-GPT and an Indian man on YouTube for making this
            possible.</p1

          <h1 class="QA_question">What are my skills</h1>
          <p class="QA_answer">
            As this abomination of computer science shows, I truly am something
            special. I'm a beloved part of any team and a girl high school
            described me as "unintentionally funny." No idea what that means,
            but it's good. Besides my socializing skills, my educational history
            is mostly on my <u><a href="about.html">About Me</a></u> page, but
            I'm currently studying Computer Science at Northeast State Community
            College.

          <h1 class="QA_question">What is this hosted on?</h1>
          <p class="QA_answer">
            As I mentioned before, this personal website was crafted while I was
            setting aside funds for some hard drives for my server. The server
            itself is an OptiPlex 3060 using an i5-8500 intel cpu with 16
            gigabytes of ram. I use it to run a few docker images including a
            minecraft server for my friends, my "alternatively sourced" media
            using jellyfin (pretty much self-hosted pirate Netflix), and a
            reverse proxy to access those services outside my LAN. Oh, and I
            can't forget this website's html pages. Me and my ISP would
            appreciate it if I didn't get DDOSed.
